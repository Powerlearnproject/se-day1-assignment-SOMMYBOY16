#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

answer:Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering approaches and evolving discipline 
that combines computer science and strategic problem solving with engineering principles, technological advancements 
and programming languages to create new software that solves all kinds of challenges for businesses and users. 
It is important in the technology industry because software is a complex and constantly evolving field that requires 
a structured approach to ensure that the end product is of high quality, reliable, and meets the needs of the users. 
It also helps business work more effectively.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
answer:
1. Requirements gathering:  This process occurs during the project initiation phase. It is the process of identifying 
your project's exact requirements from start to finish. It is important to gather your input from all of the software’s user 
groups and business stakeholders.
2. Users Acceptance Testing: This is a critical validation phase before production delivery. It gives anyone who is not a part 
of the development team a chance to validate that all the requirements are fulfilled and to catch any final issues or bugs before 
the project is released to the general public.
3. Deployment: This is the process of making software available to be used on a system by users and other programs. In this phase, 
once the software is deployed, all stakeholder teams will perform a quick test to make sure everything is running in the way it should 
be and then release the app to end-users and customers.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
answer:
1. Planning: the first phase of the Software Development Life Cycle is the project planning stage where you  evaluate the feasibility of creating the product, revenue potential, the cost of production, the needs of the end-users.
2. Requirements: This phase is critical for converting the information gathered during the planning and analysis phase into clear requirements for the development team. It determines what the application will do once launched, the necessary components, and the resources needed to launch it. 
3. Design: This phase defines how a software application will work. During this phase, teams visualize what the product will look like and decide on the programming language, screen layouts, and relevant documentation they will use without having to go through the hassle of rewriting code. 
4. Development: The actual development phase is where the development team members divide the project into software modules and turn the software requirement into code that makes the product. 
5. Testing: Before getting the software product out the door to the production environment, it’s important that different types of testing should occur, to make sure it is functioning properly and does what it’s meant to do.
6. Deployment: The deployment process starts once the testing phase is over and there are no bugs or errors in the development backlog. Then it is ready to be delivered to your intended user. 
7. Maintenance: This last phase is still important because bugs or errors missed during testing are bound to appear. These bugs need to be fixed for better user experience and retention.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
answer:
The Waterfall Model arranges all the phases sequentially, with each new phase depending on the outcome of the previous one. 
It provides structure to project management, but there is little room for changes once a phase is complete, so it's best for small, 
well-defined projects. While Agile Model is highly efficient, and rapid development cycles help teams identify issues early on, but 
overreliance on customer feedback could lead to excessive scope changes or project termination. It's best for software development projects 
that require flexibility and the ability to adapt to change over time.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
answer:
1. Software Developer: A software developer responsible for overseeing software programming, testing software at various phases of completion, 
laying out software design, building models or diagrams to communicate the end goal and mapping out future software upgrades while making improvements based 
on feedback from users.
2. Quality Assurance Engineer: The primary responsibility of the QA Engineer is to prevent defects. They are responsible for creating and running tests, 
identifying errors and providing feedback to ensure a final product meets a company's quality standards, collaborating with developers on finding and fixing 
bugs in a product or program before it's launch.
3. Project managers: they are responsible for assigning tasks, evaluating their team's performance and providing guidance throughout the software development process and ensures the project gets on track.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
answer:
An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software application that helps programmers develop software code efficiently. It increases developer productivity by 
combining capabilities such as software editing, building, testing, and packaging in an easy-to-use application. Just as writers use text editors and accountants use 
spreadsheets, software developers use IDEs to make their job easier.

Version control also known as source control or revision control is an important software development practice for tracking and managing changes made to code and other files. This allows software developers to see the entire history of who changed what at any given time  and roll back from the current version to an earlier version if they need to.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
